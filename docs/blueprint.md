## Core Features:

- Terminal Interface: Simulate a bash-like terminal interface within the web browser.

- Custom Commands: Implement custom commands like 'about', 'projects', 'resume', and 'contact' to display relevant information about the user.
- Format output: Format command outputs with appropriate styling to mimic a real terminal (e.g., colors, indentation).
- Enhance the Description: Use generative AI tool to make the interaction and description better for the end-user and recruiters.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark indigo (#4B0082) to mimic a terminal's background, creating a professional yet distinctive appearance.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-blue (#1E293B) provides a subtle backdrop that allows content to stand out.
- Accent color: A vivid violet (#EE82EE) will highlight interactive elements and commands, aligning with a futuristic and tech-forward feel.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for a code-like, terminal feel. This will be used for all text displayed on the site. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Design the layout to resemble a terminal window, with a command prompt and output area. This layout should be clean, ensuring easy readability and navigation for recruiters.
- Use subtle animations like a blinking cursor at the command prompt to enhance the terminal-like experience. Keep animations minimal to maintain a professional and functional look.
